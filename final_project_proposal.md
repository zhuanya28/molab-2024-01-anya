# finalproject

## proposal (before class)

For my final project, I want to continue developign my Study Timer. After doing some research into existing app, I have identified the features that most of the apps on the market have. The list includes:
- a to-do list with an option to add / remove items
- a timer (with customizable timing)
- background music (usually there isn't any way to choose what music is being played, it just playes on the background)
- homepage where one could see the amount of completed study sessions / achievements they earned through crossing out things from a to-do list 

Additionally, there are some of the features that I want to add that were less common:
- working out a way to disable notifications from other apps
- potentially connecting with the Apple Music API (MusicKit) to work out a way to choose from the playlists for studying that apple music has 
- integrating Unsplash (or similar) API for the photo selection
- i want to keep the "inspirational corner" & maybe integrate it with the main view, where for each study session a new one is getting displayed instead of it being on a separate page
- potentially having people collaborate on something, maybe creating a forum or having them like certain pictures or having them being able to add pictures to the shared album ("community album")

My goal for the next weeks is to dive into designing a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing app. I want to have nice menus, buttons, widgets, etc. 

If there is time left, I would like to also figure out a way to create a widget for the app? For the home screen? But I am still uncertain about that one. If I could do that without publishing the app, I will be working on that too.
