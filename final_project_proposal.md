# finalproject

## proposal (before class)

For my final project, I want to continue developign my Study Timer. After doing some research into existing app, I have identified the features that most of the apps on the market have. The list includes:
- a to-do list with an option to add / remove items
- a timer (with customizable timing)
- background music (usually there isn't any way to choose what music is being played, it just playes on the background)
- homepage where one could see the amount of completed study sessions / achievements they earned through crossing out things from a to-do list 

Additionally, there are some of the features that I want to add that were less common:
- working out a way to disable notifications from other apps
- potentially connecting with the Apple Music API (MusicKit) to work out a way to choose from the playlists for studying that apple music has 
- integrating Unsplash (or similar) API for the photo selection
- i want to keep the "inspirational corner" & maybe integrate it with the main view, where for each study session a new one is getting displayed instead of it being on a separate page

My goal for the next weeks is to dive into designing a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing app. I want to have nice menus, buttons, widgets, etc. 

If there is time left, I would like to also figure out a way to create a widget for the app? For the home screen? But I am still uncertain about that one. If I could do that without publishing the app, I will be working on that too.
